    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil for Brushing</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Honey</li> 
        <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li> 
        <li>2 Cloves Garlic, Grated</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>½ Teaspoon Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>½ Teaspoon Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>¼ Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>6 (4 Ounce) Chicken Drumsticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brush an air fryer basket with olive oil.</li>

        <li>Combine honey, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, salt, cumin, paprika, oregano, and pepper in a large bowl. Add drumsticks; toss to coat. Arrange drumsticks vertically in the prepared basket, leaning against the basket wall and one another.</li>
            
        <li>Cook in the air fryer at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of drumstick reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes. Rearrange drumsticks with kitchen tongs halfway through cooking for even cooking.</li>
            
        <li>Meanwhile, make sauce: Combine spinach, sour cream, cilantro, jalapeño, lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor; process until crema sauce is smooth.</li>
            
        <li>Drizzle some crema sauce over drumsticks and serve with remaining crema.</li>
            
    </ol>
