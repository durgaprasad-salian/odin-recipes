    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon curry powder.</li>

        <li>Heat oil in cast iron skillet to medium heat. Add chicken thighs to the skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until an instant read thermometer inserted near the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; remove thighs to a plate and keep warm.</li>
            
        <li>Drain all but about 2 tablespoons oil from the skillet. Add onions, bell peppers, and garlic and 1 tablespoon curry powder to the same skillet. Set over medium heat, and cook and stir vegetables for 5 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>Stir in coconut milk, add 1 tablespoon curry powder, and bring to a simmer. Add chicken thighs to curry sauce, cover skillet with a lid, and simmer on low heat until thighs are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Taste; season with more curry powder, salt, and pepper as needed.</li>
